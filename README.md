##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages. It includes:

- **Customer Engagement**: user reviews, titles, and content  
- **Data Size**:  
  - `1,465 rows`

Using **Excel Pivot Tables, Calculated Columns, and Filters**, I performed the following analysis:

### 1.  Average Discount by Category  
- Identified average discount percentages across different product categories.

- Summed up the number of customer reviews per category.

### 4.  Highest Average Ratings  
- Filtered products with the highest average ratings.

### 5.  Actual Price vs Discounted Price  
- Calculated average actual prices and compared them with discounted prices by category.

- Identified top products with the highest number of reviews.

### 7.  50%+ Discounted Products  
- Filtered how many products offer 50% or more discount.

### 8.  Rating Distribution  
- Analyzed the spread of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.).

### 9.  Total Potential Revenue  
- Computed estimated revenue using:  
  `Potential Revenue = Actual Price × Rating Count`

### 10.  Price Bucket Distribution
